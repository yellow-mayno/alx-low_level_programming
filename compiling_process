C Compiling process

Coponents of compiler are { preprocessor:first step to compile } then { source code move to compiler:obtaining assembly code } then  { we run the result throught an assemble:we obtain object code} then finaly { the linker:use the object code + libraries to have machine code}

Preprocessor removes comments and include the header in the program. Also, all the macros are replaced with their code.
Compiler will take the result from preprocessor and return assembly code ( mov add push .... ).
Assembler takes assembly code and give binary code (object code).
Linker links our code ( multiple object codes )  with libraries to obtain a single exe file.
